- Hi, I’m @BrendonW87
- I've always been very interested with data, and how perfoming data analysis can bring you to interesting discoveries in how things are related, or why certain things have happened
- in the way that they have.  However, I never knew anything about data analysis as a profession, and since I've recently discovered it this year, I've made it my goal to make 
- data science my career.
- I’m interested in learning all about data science and the different tools I can use for analysis.  I am excited to start learning Python and machine learning
- I’m currently learning the basics with SQL and the very intoductory parts of R.  I am excited to become a professional with these tools and move on to learn others
- I can be reached at my email at brendonwheeldon@gmail.com
